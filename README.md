# Filling Data Gaps in Fertilizer Statistics
Project for the Information Theory graduate course, Chalmers University of Technology. (Finish date: 24-03-2022)

## Description
Swedish official statistics on nitrogen (N) fertilizer use in agriculture are published every year ((link to the dataset)[http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/sv/ssd/START__MI__MI1001]). The public dataset, however, has several missing data which we aim to retrieve from the available values using an information theory analysis. 

## Dataset
Here, a simplified version of the original dataset is used, nevertheless, the same procedure can be applied to the original one as well. The dataset is available in the ```data``` directory.

## Running the code
 - Use the python script ```data.py``` (in the ```data``` directory) written by Rasmus Einarsson to generate a simplified English version of the dataset.
 - Follow the instructions in the Matlab LiveScript for changing the parameters (optional)
 - Run the entire LiveScript
